# react-comic-sans components:

Not all components need to use MS Comic Sans, but they could/should.

## Planned

In no particular order:

* Broken Java Applet (or, looks broken?)
* Marquee tag (might need a polyfill)
* Images that are auto-thumbnailed incorrectly
* Mouse trails (on hover, various elements)
* Extremely gauche color palette
* Impossible-to-control auto-play audio on loop
* Obvious abuses of tags like <big> and <font>
